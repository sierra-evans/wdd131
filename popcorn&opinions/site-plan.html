			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>Hello! My name is Sierra, and I have been a movie fanatic for pretty much my whole life. For as long as I can remember, I have loved watching movies. Rewatching them over and over to catch things I did not see the first time is also fun. Since I watch so many movies that it‚Äôs hard to keep track of them all, I decided to make this site to put all my movie reviews in one place. Feel free to look around and read my reviews at your leisure!</p>

			<h4>Current Favorite Movie: Wicked</h4>
			<p>As a lifelong fan of Wicked (and an even bigger fan of Jonathan Bailey), I went into this movie with high hopes‚Äîand somehow, it still exceeded all of them. From the opening moments, Wicked pulls you into its dazzling, emerald-hued world, balancing Broadway magic with cinematic grandeur.
			First, let‚Äôs talk about Cynthia Erivo. Her Elphaba is breathtaking. Her voice? Chills with every note. Her ability to capture Elphaba‚Äôs personality in every subtle movement she makes and line shesays is a joy to watch. And Ariana Grande as Glinda? Perfection. She brings charm, humor, and surprising depth to the role, nailing both the bubbly energy and the more serious moments. Theirchemistry together is everything I could have hoped for.
			Having been a fan of Jonathan Bailey for many years, I was so happy to see him in a big role in a big blockbuster movie, and he nailed it. He brought such charm and depth to Fiyero, and I am excitedto see his performance in part 2! 
			The visuals are stunning, with a mix of sweeping fantasy landscapes and intricate set details that make Oz feel more alive than ever. And the music, to no one‚Äôs surprise, is incredible. Seeing iconicsongs like Defying Gravity and No One Mourns the Wicked on the big screen made me emotional from start to finish.
			Whether you're a die-hard Wicked fan or new to the story, this adaptation is pure movie magic. It‚Äôs emotional, visually stunning, and full of heart. ü©∑üíö</p>

			<h4>Most Recent Watch: Crimson Peak</h4>
			<p>Crimson Peak is a film that has stayed with me due to its stunning visuals and gothic atmosphere. Guillermo del Toro crafts a world that feels like a fever dream, filled with decaying grandeur, blood-red clay, and ghosts that are as tragic as they are terrifying. It‚Äôs a beautifully haunting film, but one that struggles with pacing and sometimes odd dialogue.
			The strongest aspect of Crimson Peak is its aesthetic. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the candlelit hallways of Allerdale Hall to the intricate Victorian costumes. The house itself is oppressive and decayed, a perfect setting for a slow, creeping horror. Del Toro doesn‚Äôt rely too much on jump scares, instead building tension through unsettling imagery and a sense of inevitable doom.
			The performances are strong, though the characters occasionally feel constrained by the script. Mia Wasikowska does well as Edith, the idealistic writer caught in something far darker than she expected, but at times, she feels more like a passive observer than an active participant. Tom Hiddleston brings a quiet melancholy to Thomas Sharpe, making him a compelling, if tragic, figure. Jessica Chastain is a real standout. Her performance is chilling, restrained at first but unraveling into something far more disturbing.
			Where Crimson Peak falters is in its pacing. The film takes its time getting to Allerdale Hall, and even once there, it lingers on its atmosphere without always pushing the story forward. The dialogue, while fitting for the gothic genre, can feel overly theatrical, making certain moments lose their weight. The film works best when it allows its visuals and performances to speak for themselves rather than over-explaining its themes.
			Despite these flaws, Crimson Peak is an experience worth having. It‚Äôs more gothic romance than horror. While the storytelling doesn‚Äôt always match the strength of its visuals, it‚Äôs still a film that stays with you‚Äîunsettling, melancholic, and undeniably beautiful. üëª</p>

			<h4>Next on Watchlist: Snow White (2025)</h4>
			<p>I am planning on seeing this movie soon, and I am concerned for if it will be passable or not. The early reviews do not paint a good picture, and not to mention the production itself has been steeped in controversy from pretty much day one. However, the original Snow White is my sister‚Äôs favorite Disney Princess film, and it is classic that I enjoy from time to time as well, so I plan to see it despite the reviews and negativity surrounding the movie. üçé</p>

			<h4>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h4>
			<p>Some films entertain, some leave an impact, and then there‚Äôs The Return of the King‚Äîa film that defines what cinema can be. No matter how many times I watch it, I‚Äôm in complete awe of its scale, emotion, and sheer storytelling power. It‚Äôs not just my favorite movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy; it‚Äôs my favorite movie of all time.
			Peter Jackson crafts a finale that is nothing short of breathtaking. The battles are immense, yet never hollow‚Äîeach moment weighted with stakes and emotion. The Siege of Minas Tirith is a masterclassin spectacle, from the terrifying might of the Oliphants to Gandalf‚Äôs defiant stand against despair. And then there‚Äôs the Battle of the Black Gate‚Äîraw, desperate, and utterly gripping. Yet, as grandas these moments are, the heart of the film remains in its quieter, more intimate scenes.
			The performances are phenomenal. Viggo Mortensen‚Äôs Aragorn fully steps into his destiny, balancing strength with humility. Sean Astin delivers one of the most moving performances in thetrilogy‚ÄîSamwise Gamgee is the heart of this story, and his unwavering devotion to Frodo is what makes their journey so powerful. And speaking of Frodo, Elijah Wood captures the toll of the Ring in away that feels painfully real. Every character, from √âowyn‚Äôs quiet strength to Gollum‚Äôs tragic cunning, feels essential.
			The film‚Äôs length has been debated, especially its extended epilogue, but for me, every moment is earned. After such an epic journey, we need to see the weight of what was lost and gained. The GreyHavens scene? Absolutely devastating in the best way, I cry every time.
			There‚Äôs a reason Return of the King swept the Oscars‚Äîit‚Äôs a cinematic achievement that remains unparalleled. It‚Äôs not just an epic; it‚Äôs a story about friendship, sacrifice, and the enduring hopethat even in the darkest of times, light can prevail. No matter how many years pass, this film remains memorable and is truly a treat to watch every time. üëë</p>

			<h4>Dune Part One</h4>
			<p>Few films manage to completely transport you into another world the way Dune: Part One does. From the first frame to the last, Denis Villeneuve crafts an experience that is overwhelming in the best way‚Äîstunning visuals, haunting sound design, and a score that feels otherworldly. This isn‚Äôt just a film; it‚Äôs an immersion into something vast, brutal, and breathtaking.
			Visually, Dune is nothing short of spectacular. The sweeping desert landscapes, the sheer scale of the ships, the intricate costume and set designs‚Äîevery detail is meticulous and purposeful. There‚Äôsa weight to everything, a sense that Arrakis isn‚Äôt just a backdrop but a living, breathing force of its own. The sandworms, in particular, are awe-inspiring, their presence felt long before theyappear.
			Then there‚Äôs Hans Zimmer‚Äôs score. It doesn‚Äôt just accompany the film; it consumes it. The pounding drums, eerie vocals, and deep, resonant tones make every moment feel massive. Combined with thefilm‚Äôs sound design‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the hum of a shield activating or the deafening silence before an explosion‚Äîit creates an atmosphere that stays with you.
			The performances are just as powerful. Timoth√©e Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to Paul Atreides, capturing both his uncertainty and his growing realization of the path before him. Rebecca Fergusonis phenomenal as Lady Jessica, balancing strength and vulnerability in every scene. Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa bring gravitas to their roles, while Stellan Skarsg√•rd‚Äôs Baron Harkonnenis as grotesque as he is menacing. Even with limited screen time, Zendaya leaves an impression, making Chani feel like an integral part of Paul‚Äôs journey.
			Dune: Part One was my first introduction to the series, and I am glad it was. It‚Äôs the kind of film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible, not just watched but felt. üíô</p>

			<h4> Nosferatu (2024)</h4>
			<p>Robert Eggers' Nosferatu is a film that captivates the senses, immersing viewers in a hauntingly beautiful gothic landscape. The movie masterfully captures the decay of its Victorian setting, with shadows and light playing critical roles in creating an oppressive atmosphere. However, while the film excels in its visual and auditory presentation, it stumbles in narrative pacing, leading to a somewhat disjointed storytelling experience. 
			The cinematography is nothing short of mesmerizing. Each frame is meticulously composed, echoing the style of early cinema and heightening the film‚Äôs eerie ambiance. The use of negative space and claustrophobic framing keeps viewers on edge, making the environment as much a character as the actors themselves. 
			Complementing the visuals is a haunting score that lingers long after the credits roll. The music, paired with meticulous sound design, amplifies the sense of dread permeating the film. Every creak,whisper, and distant howl is rendered with great detail, enveloping the audience in an unsettling soundscape.
			The performances are commendable, with Bill Skarsg√•rd delivering a deeply unsettling portrayal of Count Orlok. His embodiment of the vampire is both grotesque and unsettling, capturing the essence of a monster who only exists to feed. Lily-Rose Depp brings a delicate yet resilient presence to her role, effectively conveying a spectrum of emotions that anchor the human element of the story.  
			Despite these strengths, the film's pacing presents challenges. This uneven rhythm can lead to moments where the tension dissipates, undermining the overall impact of the story. While the deliberate pacing may be an artistic choice to mirror the slow-building dread of classic horror, it left me feeling bored at certain points.
			In conclusion, Nosferatu (2024) stands as a testament to Robert Eggers' directorial vision, offering a film that is visually and sonically captivating. However, the uneven pacing and occasional narrative sluggishness prevent it from achieving its full potential. For viewers who appreciate atmospheric horror and meticulous craftsmanship, this rendition of Nosferatu provides a compelling,albeit imperfect, cinematic experience. üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
